# Dependency Review Action
#
# NOTE: This workflow is DISABLED because it requires GitHub Advanced Security
# to be enabled, which is not available on this repository.
#
# This Action will scan dependency manifest files that change as part of a Pull Request,
# surfacing known-vulnerable versions of the packages declared or updated in the PR.
# Once installed, if the workflow run is marked as required,
# PRs introducing known-vulnerable packages will be blocked from merging.
#
# To enable: Enable "Dependency graph" and "GitHub Advanced Security" in repository settings
